# Poker-Hand-Classification
In this, we built a classifier that uses the CART decision tree algorithm to classify the strength of a given poker hand

Decision Tree algorithms are a great way of classifying new instances. Collection of five, eight or  more  cards  in  a  cards  game
are  normally  called  poker  hands.  There  are  various  poker variations, each with different poker hands ranking. 
In the project, an attempt is made to solve poker hand classification problem using the CART algorithm. 
Poker data set is touted to be a difficult dataset for classification algorithms. The proposed model succeeded in classification of 
poker hands with 57.57% classification accuracy
